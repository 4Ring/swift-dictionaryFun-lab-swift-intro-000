## Learning Objectives - The student should be able to..

* Practice creating and using a dictionary.
* Write methods to interpret the information in a dictionary.
* Change/update/add values to the dictionary.

## What the student can do at this point 

* Create variables and constants
* Is familiar with type annotations, type inference and string interpolation.
* Can create functions with return types.
* Is familiar with the String, Int, Double, and Bool type.
* Can perform arithmetic operations on Int and Double.
* Understands if and else clause statements.
* Can create and use Arrays.
* Can iterate over an Array using a for-in loop.
* Can iterate over an Array calling enumerate().
* Work with the following methods on arrays:
	* append()
	* insert(_:atIndex:)
	* removeAtIndex()
	* subscript syntax with arrays
	* count
	* isEmpty
	* Optionals
* Can work with dictionaries 
* Can iterate over a dictionary
* Knows about optionals (should at this point)

## Outline / Notes

*  There were labs made in the past that involved dictionaries that serve as good examples for what we can create here.
* [OBJ-C Dictionary Lab involving ice-cream](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/objc-dictionary-ice-cream)
* [OBJ-C Dictionary Lab](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/locationTrivia-Dictionaries)
* We don't have to include a UI here or have them interact with Storyboard at all. I'm not against just using Xcode to have them implement methods which we test (like the two labs I linked above).
* That being said, if we were to have them implement something like the ice-cream lab, we could introduce some fun simple UI elements for them to mess with.
