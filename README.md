> How wonderful it is that nobody need wait a single moment before starting to improve the world.

## Learning Objectives - The student should be able to...

* Practice creating and using a dictionary.
* Write methods to interpret the information in a dictionary.
* Change/update/add values to the dictionary.

## Instructions

This lab has been implemented in a playground file. The playground includes several "stub" functions that don't do anything useful. Your task is to fix these functions so they return the correct values. The playground includes testing code which you _should_ not change, but will test whether you have fixed the functions properly.

More detailed instructions are available in the playground file itself. Open `IceCream.playground` to get started.
