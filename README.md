> Forget art. Put your trust in ice cream. -[Charles Baxter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Baxter_(author))

## Overview

In this lab, you'll create and change, update, and add values to a dictionary. You'll also write methods to interpret the information in a dictionary. 

## Instructions

This lab has been implemented in a playground file. The playground includes several "stub" functions that don't do anything useful. Your task is to fix these functions so they return the correct values. The playground includes testing code which you _should_ not change, but will test whether you have fixed the functions properly.

More detailed instructions are available in the playground file itself. Open `IceCream.playground` to get started.
